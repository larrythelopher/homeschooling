# [🎓 Homeschooling Operating System](/)

# Academic Foundations (Literacy & Numeracy)

## Goal
Solid, calm fluency in reading, writing, and maths.

## Philosophy
Fluency matters more than acceleration. Short, consistent practice beats intensity. Pressure erodes learning.

## System
- Two daily anchors (AM + PM)
- Rotate focus between reading, writing, and maths
- No grades, no pressure, no comparison
