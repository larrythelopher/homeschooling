# Social Fluency & Worldliness

## Goal
Children who communicate comfortably across age, sex, and socio-economic lines.

## Philosophy
Social skill comes from variety and repetition, not age-segregation alone. A secure family base enables confident outward engagement.

## System
- Designed social exposure (clubs, sport, group activities)
- Mixed-age environments
- Regular interaction with adults
- Children speak for themselves where appropriate
- Parents model calm, respectful communication
