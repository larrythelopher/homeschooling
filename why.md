# Why We Homeschool

## Goal
Build a close, loving, generous family unit while raising children who can think, choose, learn, and act in the real world.

## Philosophy
Education is not preparation for life — it *is* life. Time together, shared work, and unhurried presence matter as much as academic outcomes.

## System
- Prioritise shared time, meals, projects, and rituals
- Design days with both structure and freedom
- Optimise for long-term character over short-term metrics
