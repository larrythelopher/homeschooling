# Daily Structure & Anchors

## Goal
Create calm rhythm and academic fluency without pressure.

## Philosophy
Consistency beats intensity. Short, predictable anchors build trust, identity, and momentum.

The anchors matter more than the content.

## System
- **AM Anchor (15–20 min):** reading, writing, or maths
- **PM Anchor (15–20 min):** reading, writing, or maths (rotate focus)
- Anchors happen even on messy days
- Stop before resistance builds
