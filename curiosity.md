# Curiosity & Learning How to Learn

## Goal
Raise children who instinctively follow curiosity and self-direct learning.

## Philosophy
Curiosity thrives under autonomy plus reality. Over-instruction kills initiative. Learning accelerates when children pursue genuine interest.

Boredom is not a problem — it is often the gateway to deeper engagement.

## System
- Large blocks of unstructured time
- Boredom allowed (rescue from distress, not discomfort)
- Resources provided on demand
- Parents ask questions instead of giving answers
