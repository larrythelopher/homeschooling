# 🎓 Homeschooling Operating System

This site documents how our family approaches education, learning, and development.

We homeschool to:
- strengthen our family bond
- cultivate curiosity and agency
- raise capable, socially fluent children

This is a living operating system, reviewed slowly and deliberately.
