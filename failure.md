# Failure, Resilience & Decision-Making

## Goal
Children comfortable choosing, failing, adjusting, and trying again.

## Philosophy
Confidence comes from survived failure, not protection from it. Decision-making is a skill developed through practice and consequence.

## System
- Children make real, age-appropriate decisions
- Consequences are allowed to play out
- Low parental rescue
- Brief reflection after outcomes, then move on
