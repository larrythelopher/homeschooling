# Travel, Access & World Exposure

## Goal
Use time freedom to give children lived, embodied understanding of the world.

## Philosophy
Choosing a non-conformist structure creates practical advantages: off-peak access, lower cost, fewer crowds, and richer experiences.

Travel is not a reward or a break from learning — it is a core learning input.

## System
- Travel outside school holidays as default
- Short, opportunistic trips tied to curiosity
- Use real places to anchor learning (history, geography, culture)
- Prioritise depth over itinerary volume
- Treat travel as normal life, not disruption
